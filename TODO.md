# Non Essential Fixes

- [ ] Menu sidebar close button transition (`solid-transition-group` Does not support child animations)
- [ ] Remove `Modal`/`SlideOver`/`MobileSidebar` components exit animation workaround (Depends on `solid-transition-group`)
- [ ] Fix `clickOutside` directive not recognized by TypeScript that it's being used (Currently preserving the import by referencing the import)
